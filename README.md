# TriviaGame

A timed trivia game where a final score of questions answered correctly, incorrectly or not answered are displayed upon completion or no time left.

Questions are hard-coded on the HTML page with the correct answer stored in the "answer" array in the app.js file that is used to check the answers the user chose.
